# Physics 166 - THV - [2nd] AY2018-2019

**Description**: Coherence theory; Fourier optics and imaging; basic microscopy; spectroscopy;
nonlinear optics

**Objectives**: At the end of the course the learner will be able to

1. Explain the workings of a microscope.
2. Explain the workings of an interferometer
3. Know the workings of a spectrometer
4. Express transmission and reflection in thin films as a matrix
5. Express polarization as a Jones matrix
6. Use Fourier Transform to model imaging systems
7. Model aberrations in lens systems
8. Discuss nonlinear optical effects


## Code Organization

Upon cloning, the repository contains the following directories:

* **166_PDF1.ipynb** - familiarization with discrete FFT, simulation of an imaging device, template matching using correlation, edge detection

* **166_PDF2.ipynb** - contains anamorphic property of FT of different 2D patters, rotation property of FT, convolution theorem redux, ridge enhancement of fingerprints, line removal of lunar landing scanned pictures

## Acknowledgement
